<div><p class="para">Assalamu alaikum. This is Payel. Today I'm going to write about my <span> 'Sajek Valley Tour'.</span> <br> <br>Let's start from the beginning.Firstly,we started our journey from Dohar to Dhaka. After reaching Dhaka, we passed our time by roaming around the city. At sharp 10 pm, we got on the bus.The name of the bus was 'Hanif Enterprise'. Personally, I love the bus as I have travelled a lot by this bus and it also has quite comfortable seats which are indeed for long time journey.</p></div>

<div><p class="para">So, the bus was started within 30 minutes. It was at it's high speed the whole time as the roads stays clear at night. The bus gave us break for 15 minutes in Cumilla at midnight. Then we reached at Khagrachari at around 6:30 am. I was happy but also was getting the dizzy feeling cause the road was like roller coaster.</p></div>

<div><p class="para">We ate khichuri and fried egg as breakfast at Khagrachari. The worst khichuri I ever had in my whole existence. Later we got on a jeep which was the best part of the journey. The jeep was cool as well as dangerous too. On our way to Baghaihat Camp from Khagrachari , I was almost asleep the whole time. After reaching to the camp , we had some snacks and started our final journey to Sajek. The roads were dangerous, but the view of the mountains left me speechless.This time, I stayed fully awake, captured some photos and videos and enjoyed the beautiful view.</p></div>

<div><p class="para">Finally, er reached sajek. That was a great feeling, we felt like we're at the top of everything. We went to resort and freshen up lil bit. The we had our lunch. Oh my goodness, the food was so delightful. Literally we asked the waiter where the rice came from, how could we get them and how the process everything etcetera.Then we started visiting around sajek.We visited_ </p></div>
